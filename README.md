# CloudKitManager
CRUD operations for the Apple CloudKit integration. 

Can also be used in a reactive way: 

Add [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift) and [Result](https://github.com/antitypical/Result) in the project through pods so that CloudKitManager can expose its reactive programming methods 

# Installation

**CocoaPods**

If you use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) to manage your dependencies, simply add
CloudKitManager to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'CloudKitManager'
```
